## Adaptive Futures

*Adaptive Futures* is a 'serious game' designed to introduce players to community-level decision-making and climate change adaptation. The research used to produce the game was conducted jointly through [NIWA Taihoro Nukurangi](http://www.niwa.co.nz) and [Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research](http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz), and funded by the [Natural Hazards Platform](http://www.naturalhazards.org.nz). The game is programmed using the [Twine platform](http://twinery.org), which combines visual and in-built coding elements with CSS and Javascript to write non-linear 'stories'. The project is published to HTML and hosted on a Github page.

The objective of the game is to protect the Seaview community from the adverse effects of climate change. Doing this will require the player to take actions to adapt to these effects, and their ability to take action depends on support from the community. Maintaining that support means that the player will need to build trust with community members, who experience the effects of climate change differently depending on their own values and location within the coastal space. Therefore, the game requires the player to balance the wishes of the community with the need to mitigate the immediate and long-term effects of climate change.
